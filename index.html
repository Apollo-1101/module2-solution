      <h2>Chicken</h2>
      <p>
        Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the
        relative ease and low cost of raising chickens—in comparison to mammals
        such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat and chicken eggs have become
        prevalent in numerous cuisines.
